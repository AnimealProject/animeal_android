The project expects a gradle-variable defined inside `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`,
which points to the secrets-directory for this project.

`ANIMEAL_SECRETS_FOLDER=/Users/Janis_Graumanis/Documents/secrets/animeal-app-secrets`

At this point the project expects that directory to contain the two config-files generated by aws-amplify:
* awsconfiguration.json
* amplifyconfiguration.json




Follow instructions here for preparation required to generate your own copies of those config-json files:
https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMEDU/Access+AWS+resources

You will need to setup:
* AMPLIFY-CLI (https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/),
* AWS-VAULT (https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault), 
* AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

When doing setup of AWS-VAULT be sure to keep the `~/.aws/config` identical to what it is like in the instructions;
including applying of an identical region & role.

Once you can access AWS for this project (`aws-vault exec animeal -- aws s3 ls` returns valid results),
you can follow the instructions here (`https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMEDU/Amplify`) and generate the AWS-config-files listed above.
This `aws-vault exec animeal  -- amplify pull` will do the json-generation; 
you might need to move the generated configs to your secrets folder.
